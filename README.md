# PCF | Egyptian Nationl Id Validator

Powerapps Component Framework

Egyptian Nationl Id Validator is a PCF control that validates the Egyptian national identification number thoroughly on a Dataverse \ Dynamics 365 UCI form.

The control also outputs "Birthday" and "Gender" values that could be easily bound to their adjacent fields.

The PCF controles do not have a "prevent form submit on invalide input" option and so the validation is merely CSS representiation of correct\incorrect input text status, however, a workaround it to make the field mandatory as the control does not output value if the input is not a valid national Id which will prevent form save.

Demo of the control can be found in the below URL
